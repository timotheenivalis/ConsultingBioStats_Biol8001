## Mosquito fish

We are going to re-analyse the gambusia dataset, focusing on ```No.Cop_Attempts``` this time.

1. Load the dataset ```Gambusia.csv``` and visualize the distribution of ```No.Cop_Attempts```. Given what you see, why would a linear model not be appropriate to analyse those data? (1pt)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
gambusia <- read_csv("Data/Gambusia.csv")
ggplot(gambusia, aes(x=No.Cop_Attempts)) + geom_histogram()
```

<!-- **A linear model would probably not be a good tool here, because linear models fit a continuous response variable without bounds whereas the response variable here takes only positive integer values.** -->


2. Fit a GLM to test whehter time spent close to the female (```Time_Female.sec```) affect ```No.Cop_Attempts```? Assess the fit of the model; does this model capture variation in the response well? If not, try a different count data GLM family. (1pt) 

```{r}
library(glmmTMB)

m_tfs <- glmmTMB(No.Cop_Attempts ~ 1 + Time_Female.sec, data = gambusia, family = "nbinom1")
summary(m_tfs)
library(DHARMa)
testResiduals(m_tfs)
```

```{r}
library(janitor)
fsimul <- function(x) {
  tibble(simul=simulate(m_tfs)) %>% 
  tabyl(simul)
  }

tibbsimul2 <- map_dfr(.x = 1:100, .f = fsimul)

ggplot(gambusia, aes(x=No.Cop_Attempts))+geom_bar() +
  geom_jitter(data = tibbsimul2, width = 0.1,height = 0,
             mapping = aes(x=simul, y=n, col=as.factor(simul)),
             alpha=0.4, inherit.aes = FALSE) + xlim(-1,30)+ ggtitle("Nbinom1 GLM")


```



3. Make a graph of number of copulation attempts as a function of time spent close to the female and show the model prediction with confidence interval (1pt).

```{r}
library(emmeans)
mm_tfs <- as_tibble(emmeans(m_tfs, ~ Time_Female.sec, at=list(Time_Female.sec=seq(0, 520, length.out = 100)), type="response"))

ggplot(gambusia, aes(y=No.Cop_Attempts, x=Time_Female.sec)) + geom_point() +
  geom_line(data=mm_tfs, aes(y=response), col="red")+
  geom_ribbon(data=mm_tfs, aes(x=Time_Female.sec, ymin=lower.CL, ymax=upper.CL), inherit.aes = FALSE,
              fill="red", alpha=0.1)

```


4. Discuss whether the effect of ```Time_Female.sec``` is surprising? Is the intercept is biologically meaningful and why? Try to explain why this is an intrinsic limitation of count data GLMs. (2pt)

<!-- **Time_Female.sec has a positive effect on No.Cop_Attempts. This is not surprising since a male needs to spend time close to a female in order to attempt copulation. We could have predicted the direction of the effect without even looking at the data. However, fitting a model lets us quantify exactly the strength of that effect and the variation around it: some males spend lots of time with females but still attempt few copulations.** -->

<!-- **The intercept is not biologically meaningful, because if a male spends 0s with a female, it is logically impossible for him to attempt any copulations. Ideally you would like your model to predict exactly 0 copulation attempts when Time_Female.sec is 0. But that is impossible. A count data GLM can predict only positive values, because it uses a log-link function and the logarithm of 0 is not defined mathematically. That is an intrinsic limitation of this type of GLMs. In practice it is not a problem because the model could still predict a value very close to zero.** -->

## Red deer

We monitor a wild population of red deer on a Scottish island. Every year, a few immigrants enter the population and succesfully reproduce, thus introducing non-local genes. We expect the population to be locally adapted to its habitat and immigrant genes to produce maladaptation, that is, to decrease reproductive success.
**We want to test whether immigrant ancestry affects lifetime reproductive success (the number of babies each individual had) in the population.**

For each individual we know ```lifetime_reproduction``` (number of babies), ```sex ``` (Male or Female), ```ImmGeneticAncestry``` (the proportion of genetic ancestry coming from immigrants, as opposed to ancesters that where local at the beginning of the study), and ```ShotOrNot``` (indicating whether an individual died from natural causes = ```DeadNotShot```; died from hunting = ```Shot```; or is still alive ```Living```).



```{r, eval=FALSE}
dat <- read.table("fitnessdata.txt", header = TRUE)
data <- dat[,c("Code", "LBS", "GGImm", "Sex", "ShotOrNot")]
colnames(data) <- c("individual", "lifetime_reproduction", "ImmGeneticAncestry",  "sex", "ShotOrNot")
data$individual <- as.integer(data$individual)

write.csv(data,file = "red_deer.csv", row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
```

1. Load the dataset ```red_deer.csv```. Filter out the individuals that are still alive (```ShotOrNot=="Living"```) since we not really know their lifetime reproduction yet. Visualize the distribution of lifetime reproduction for each sex. Do you think you will need to account for sex in models? (1pt).

```{r}
deer <- read_csv("Data/red_deer.csv")
deer <- deer %>% filter(ShotOrNot != "Living")

ggplot(deer, aes(lifetime_reproduction)) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(~sex)
```

<!-- **The distributions of lifetime reprodiction are quite different for females vs. males, so we should probably include sex in the models. ** -->

2. Does the proportion of immigrant genetic ancestry affect lifetime reproduction? Fit a negative-binomial 1 GLM to quantify and test the effect of immigrant genetic ancestry. What happens if you add an additive effect for sex? (1pt) (+ bonus 0.5pt if you can explain why sex changes the result)

```{r}
m0 <- glmmTMB(lifetime_reproduction ~ 1 + ImmGeneticAncestry, data = deer, family = nbinom1())
summary(m0)

m_sex <- glmmTMB(lifetime_reproduction ~ 1 + ImmGeneticAncestry + sex, data = deer, family = nbinom1())
summary(m_sex)

```


<!-- The effect of ImmGeneticAncestry has a lower estimate and larger p-value when we include sex in the model. That is in part because sex and ImmGeneticAncestry are correlated, and in part because the effect of ImmGeneticAncestry is opposite in males vs. females (as we will see in the next question). -->

```{r}
cor(as.integer(as.factor(deer$sex)), deer$ImmGeneticAncestry)
glmmTMB(lifetime_reproduction ~ 1 + ImmGeneticAncestry, data = deer[deer$sex=="Female",], family = nbinom1())
glmmTMB(lifetime_reproduction ~ 1 + ImmGeneticAncestry, data = deer[deer$sex=="Male",], family = nbinom1())
```


3. Add to the GLM the intercation between sex and ImmGeneticAncestry. Use emmeans and ggplot to make a graph of lifetime reproduction as a function of ImmGeneticAncestry and sex with model predictions and confidence intervals (1pt).

```{r}
m0 <- glmmTMB(lifetime_reproduction ~ 1 + sex * ImmGeneticAncestry, data = deer, family = nbinom1())

emm_sex_g <- as_tibble(emmeans(m0, ~ sex * ImmGeneticAncestry, 
                               at=list(ImmGeneticAncestry=seq(0,1, length.out = 100)),
                               type="response"))

ggplot(deer, aes(y=lifetime_reproduction, x=ImmGeneticAncestry, col=sex)) + geom_point(alpha=0.3) + 
  geom_line(data=emm_sex_g, aes(y=response)) +
  geom_ribbon(data=emm_sex_g, 
                aes(x= ImmGeneticAncestry, ymin=lower.CL, ymax=upper.CL, fill=sex),
                inherit.aes = FALSE, alpha=0.3) + ylim(0,10)

```


4. Assess the ability of the model to generate the real data. You can use DHARMa and/or a simulation approach. Is it satisfactory; what aspects are not optimal? What could be the consequences of the problems you observe?  (1pt) 

```{r}
testResiduals(m0)

fsimul <- function(x) {
  tibble(simul=simulate(m0)) %>% 
  tabyl(simul)
  }

tibbsimul2 <- map_dfr(.x = 1:100, .f = fsimul)

ggplot(deer, aes(x=lifetime_reproduction))+geom_bar() +
  geom_jitter(data = tibbsimul2, 
             mapping = aes(x=simul, y=n, col=as.factor(simul)),
             alpha=0.4, inherit.aes = FALSE) + xlim(-1,12)+ ggtitle("Nbinom1 GLM")


```

<!-- **The model shows under-dispersion compare to the data. The model produces more values 1 and 2 than there are in the data. That is probably because there are many 0s in the data. The model does a good job at predicting the amount of 0s, but in doing so produces a wrongly shaped distribution. A consequence of under-dispersion is a likely over-estimation of p-values. More in general, if the fit is poor we will trust less parameter estimates.** -->


5. Try other count data GLM families. Do they work better? Discuss what else you could do, or what property should a GLM have to better represent these data. (1pt)

<!-- **Simple GLM families will not fix the problem. There is an excess of zero in the data. Biologically that is because the distribution of lifetime reproduction comes from two distinct processes: survival and reproduction. A deer needs to survive until adulthood to get a chance of getting any reproductive success. Once a deer is adult, it may or may not reproduce. So, we have a combination of a bernoulli process (survival) and a Poisson process (reproduction), both of which can generate zero. We would need a model that is aware of these two processes. Such models include zero-inflated and hurdle models and are available in glmmTMB.** -->
