Assignment 3

Briefly read the following paper, and download the data from this experiment:
Mantella NM, Youngentob SL (2014) Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Increases Postnatal Acceptability of Nicotine Odor and Taste in Adolescent Rats. PLoS ONE 9(7): e102255. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0102255 

You can find both the data and the paper in Dryad: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.32875

Produce an Rmarkdown document in which you answer the following questions. These questions fit together to produce a statistical workflow.

Describe the set-up for Experiment 2, including how baby rats were selected for the experiment. What were the research questions being addressed?  What responses were measured? What were the experimental factors of interest? (2 points)

Import the data. Rename variables, restructure data and merge data sets as needed. You can have one data set for the latency data, and one data set for the average licks data. Be sure to annotate your code for transparency. (2 points)

Data exploration. Show 3-4 plots that show the distribution of each response for each treatment group. The exploratory plots should address the research questions for the experiment. (2 points)

Model fit. 
    • Fit models to the data that reflect Figures 2 and 3 in the paper. Produce appropriate model assessment plot. (1 point)
    • Interpret the model output and residual plots using non-technical language. (1 point) 
    • Reproduce Figures 2 and 3 in the paper, using your estimated means and SE. You should convey the same information as those figures, but the plot itself does not need to be identical. (1 points)

Do your model estimates confirm or contradict the paper’s conclusions? Explain in a paragraph. (1 point)
