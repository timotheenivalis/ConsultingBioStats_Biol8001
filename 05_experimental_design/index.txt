In this unit, we'll cover Principles of Experimental Design.  Whilst these principles can seem abstract, or too obvious, or not particularly relevant to real experiments, we spend class time on Friday 14 October designing a "real" experiment and analysing data from this experiment. 

I say real experiment, because this was a real experiment carried out in Western Australia with the goal of understanding how changing climate (precipitation and temperature) can impact on growing plants. The researchers identified 4 Banksia species and 6 populations of each species. They grew seedlings in open sheds to mimic local growing conditions but created different local micro-environments to assess effects of watering conditions and soil temperature on plant growth and development. 

In preparation for Friday's discussion, think about the principles of experimental design and how apply to this particular experiment. Have a few ideas ready to contribute to the discussion.
